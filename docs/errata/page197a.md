## It is (solution, second method)

Using the second method, you should get the solution $W'W'$, where $W'$ is the converse
warbler -- $W'xy = yxx$. If you get $CW(CW)$ you are also right, since $CW$ is a
converse warbler. You can easily check that $W'W'x=x(W'W')$.

## It should become

Using the second method, you should get the solution $CL(CL)$, equivalent
to the longer $S,K,I$-expression $A_2A_2$ where $A_2=S(K(SI))(S(KK)(SII))$.

## Short explanation

The second method requires first to find a bird satisfying $A_2yx=x(yy)$;
either by the algorithm illustrated in Chapter 18 or by direct derivation,
one finds the above result

$$
    A_2 = CL = S(K(SI))(S(KK)(SII))\;,
$$

leading to the right solution.

The expression given in the text does _not_ fulfill the requirement: indeed,

$$
    W'W'x = xW'W' \neq x(W'W')
$$

because

$$
    W'xy=yxx \neq y(xx)\,
$$

where the parentheses are required if one is to honour the original expression given in the
Problem of finding a bird $A$ such that $Ax=xA$ for any $x$.
