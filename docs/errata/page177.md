## It is (line 11 from top of the page)

... Well, an $x$-eliminate of $S(S(KS)K)$ is $K(S(S(KS)K))$
and an $x$-eliminate of $Kx$ is $K$, so
$S(K(S(S(KS)K))K)$
is an $x$-eliminate of $S(S(KS)K)(Kx)$,
and hence is a queer bird, as the reader can verify.

## It should become

... Well, an $x$-eliminate of $S(S(KS)K)$ is $K(S(S(KS)K))$
and an $x$-eliminate of $Kx$ is $K$, so
$S(K(S(S(KS)K)))K$
is an $x$-eliminate of $S(S(KS)K)(Kx)$,
and hence is a queer bird, as the reader can verify.

## Short explanation

By application of Principle 4 stated a few pages before, one sees that
the last $x$-eliminate provided in the text requires a closing parenthesis
to be moved before the final Kestrel, as can be verified
by direct computation.
