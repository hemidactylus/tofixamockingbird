__Location:__ In "The Secret", procedure for writing any expression $X$ in terms of $S, K, I$,
in the numbered list after "_We can arrange our work as follows_:".

_Warning_: two wrong expressions and a whole line of text replaced by a copy of another line.

## Numbered point 3

### It is

3\. Therefore $S(SI)K$ is an $x$-eliminate of $SI(Kx)$.

### It should become (correcting the expression)

3\. Therefore $S(K(SI))K$ is an $x$-eliminate of $SI(Kx)$.

## Numbered point 5

### It is

5\. Hence, according to steps 4 and 3 and Principle 4,
$S(S(KS)(S(SI)K))I$ is an $x$-eliminate of
$S(SI(Kx))x$ and is a

### It should become (restoring the rightful second line)

5\. Hence, according to steps 4 and 3 and Principle 4,
$S(KS)(S(K(SI))K)$ is an $x$-eliminate of
$S(SI(Kx))$.

## Numbered point 7

### It is

7\. Therefore, according to steps 5 and 6 and Principle 4,
$S(S(KS)(S(SI)K))I$ is an $x$-eliminate of
$S(SI(Kx))x$ and is a combinator $A$ doing ...

### It should become (correcting the expression)

7\. Therefore, according to steps 5 and 6 and Principle 4,
$S(S(KS)(S(K(SI))K))I$ is an $x$-eliminate of
$S(SI(Kx))x$ and is a combinator $A$ doing ...

## Short explanation

This looks like a typesetting messing up has hit right on a pre-existing
typo in the formula. The corrected expression may be checked
by plugging them in front of the variables and doing the calculation,
or even simply by using the Principles provided shortly before in the text.
