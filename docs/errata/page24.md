__Location:__ Chapter 3, solution to Problem 2

## It is (lines 1-3)

```text 
    ... It could be that Roberto shaves
    himself, Arturo shaves Roberto, Arturo doesn't shave himself,
    and Roberto doesn't shave Arturo. ...
```

## It should become

```text 
    ... It could be that Roberto shaves
    himself, Arturo shaves Roberto, Arturo SHAVES himself,
    and Roberto doesn't shave Arturo. ...
```

## Short explanation

Probably a typesetting issue, since the above correction simply makes the described situation
compatible with the requirement of Problem 2. So, no paradox after all.
