__Location:__ Chapter 8, solution to Problem 2. In particular, the seventh paragraph on the page, lines 5-7.

## It is

... or he could be a knight who truthfully
claimed that the fountain was on the island and who also
claimed that the fountain was not on the island. ...

## It should become

... or he could be a knight who truthfully
claimed that the fountain __was not__ on the island and who also __never__
claimed that the fountain was not on the island. ...

## Short explanation

The line of reasoning presented in the book requires the corrections given above
in order to comply with the subcase of $B_2$ in which $B$ is a knight.

## About a different claim

In this [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/2o2jko/i_think_i_found_a_subtle_flaw_in_one_of_raymond/) (dating back to 2014),
doubts are raised over an important part of the solution: namely, it is argued that
the reasoning in the _Case $A_2$_ last paragraph of page 68
("In this case, here is how Reynolds would reason: ...") is flawed.

More precisely, the discussion goes, how could (the hypothetical, case-$A_2$) Reynolds include in
his reasoning the fact that the fountain is _not_ on the island, a fact not yet available
to him at the time (remember the question asked by Craig is
"do you know whether you would have been able, _at the time_,
to draw a conclusion on the fountain, had the other person answered instead?")

But this objection seems questionable: imagine, at present time (the time when Craig and Reynolds discuss),
Craig having models of Reynolds-on-the-island in mind. One of these models is the Reynolds of case $A_2$,
who, after having gotten the second answer,
_knows_ the fountain is not on the island and is able to reason as reported in the paragraph
("The island is not here, both $A$ and $B$ are knights: had $B$ answered, he would have
given a negative answer. At the time, just knowing that $B$ gave such an answer,
I would have had no chance at finding out the answer. So I am going to
tell Craig that yes, I know whether I would've been able to find out -- indeed, I would not have
been able to.").

The rest of the reasoning, once this step is cleared, proceeds as reported in the book.
__For the time being, the claim found in the thread is considered invalid, but obviously
the case would be immediately re-opened as soon as compelling evidence is presented__.
