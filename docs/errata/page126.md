## It is (last sentence):

Hence $C(HR)$ -- or alternatively $R(HR)R$ -- is a warbler.

## It should become

Hence $C(H(CC))=C(HR)$ -- or alternatively $R(HR)R$ -- is a warbler.

## Short explanation

The added expression, while equivalent by virtue of $R=CC$, is the natural
one that is encountered during the derivation hence is quite helpful if made explicit.
