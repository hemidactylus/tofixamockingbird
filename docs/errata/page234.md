## It is

We now need a bird $\Delta$ called a _normalizer_ such that
for every number $n$, $\Delta\,n = \overline{n \star n^\#}$.

## It should become

We now need a bird $\Delta$ called a _normalizer_ such that
for every number $n$, $\Delta\,\overline{n} = \overline{n \star n^\#}$.

## Short explanation

The Normalizer bird, like any other bird, can be applied not to numbers
(in the sense of elements of $\mathbb{N}$), but only to numerical birds.
Hence the need for an overlined symbol after the $\Delta$.
