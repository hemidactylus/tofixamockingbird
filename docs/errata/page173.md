## It is (top of the page, lines 5-7):

... Therefore $S(K(SI))$ is a thrush. The reader can check this
by computing $S(K(SI))xy$; he will end up with yx.

## It should become

... Therefore $S(K(SI))K$ is a thrush. The reader can check this
by computing $S(K(SI))Kxy$; he will end up with yx.

## Short explanation

The final Kestrel in the expression for $T$ is needed, indeed:

$$
    Txy=S(K(SI))Kxy=K(SI)x(Kx)y=
        SI(Kx)y=Iy(Kxy)=yx\;.
$$
