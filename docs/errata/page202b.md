## Open Questions (paragraph after Problem 17):

Is there a way to tackle the problem of (non-) egocentricity of the Sage
bird and the Mockingbird? What can be said, and how, about the questions of whether

$$
    \Theta \Theta \stackrel{?}{=} \Theta
$$

and

$$
    MM \stackrel{?}{=} M\;.
$$

## Discussion

For the Sage bird, there does not seem to be a way of deriving any evident contradiction
(such as the ones met in this chapter, $KI=I$, $KI=K$, $K=I$, $KK=K$) by assuming
$\Theta\Theta=\Theta$: all one seems to get is an infinitely-nested tower of statements
of the form:

$$
    \Theta=\Theta\Theta=\Theta(\Theta\Theta)=\Theta(\Theta(\Theta\Theta))=\Theta(\Theta(\Theta(\Theta\Theta)))=...
$$

which does not seem to lead anywhere.

A for the Mockingbird, again all one can apparently do
is to start by assuming $M=MM$ and, by applying the definition of $M$,
deriving ... that $MM=MM$, not a great progress indeed.

For $\Theta$ and $M$, is it possible to prove that they are _not_ egocentric?
Is it possible to prove that they _are_ egocentric? Are there further assumption
that can be made, such as a lower bound on the number of different birds or
some inequalities (e.g. $M \neq K$), which would help? Is it possible to prove
that the above (non-) egocentricity _cannot be proven_? To me these are, as it stands,
open questions still.
