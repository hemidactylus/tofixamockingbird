__Location:__ Chapter 21, solution to Problems 3 and 4

_Note_: additional solutions due to bird expressions equivalent to those given in the text.

## Problem 3 (c)

Besides the solution $L(LL)(L(LL))$, the following is also valid:

$$
    L(SM)(L(SM))\;,
$$

## Problem 4

Besides the solution $L(BKM)(L(BKM))$, the following is also valid:

$$
    L(LK)(L(LK))\;,
$$

## Short explanation

According to the first method illustrated in the Chapter,
any bird $A$ is a good solution
as long as it is built according to

$$
    A = LA_1(LA_1)\;,
$$

where all that is needed from $A_1$, in turn, is that it satisfies
a problem-specific condition. Hence, if more than one bird $A_1$ is
found for a certain Problem, it automatically follows that there are
more than one solution for the Problem.

For Problem 3 (c), two expressions for $A_1$ can be found:

$$
    A_1yx=LLyx=SMyx=yy(xx)\;,
$$

and likewise for Problem 4:

$$
    BKMyx=LKyx=yy\;.
$$
