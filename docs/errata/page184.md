__Location:__ Chapter 19, solution to Problem 5

## It is

_The first and last expressions in the solution read:_

We can take $C^*$ to be $Q_1C$, because ...

...

In terms of $C$ and $Q_1$, $B=(Q_1C)Q_1$.

## It should become

We can take $C^*$ to be $C(Q_1C)$, because ...

...

In terms of $C$ and $Q_1$, $B=C(Q_1C)Q_1$.

## Short explanation

The need for a Cardinal bird at the beginning of the expression is made clear by the calculation
given in the solution itself.
