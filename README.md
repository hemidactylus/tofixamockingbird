## [To Fix a Mockingbird](https://www.salamandrina.net)

After reading Smullyan's deep, delightful book
    [__To Mock a Mockingbird__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Mock_a_Mockingbird)
and going through
all of the exercises therein, I realised I had spotted quite a list of typos, errors,
notational inconsistencies, and so on.

This is the list of my findings, available in github to be compiled with [mkdocs](https://mkdocs.org)
or directly available for browsing [here](https://tofixamockingbird.salamandrina.net/).
