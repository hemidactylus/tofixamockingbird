## Introduction

After reading Smullyan's deep, delightful book
    [__To Mock a Mockingbird__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Mock_a_Mockingbird)
and going through
all of the exercises therein, I realised I had spotted quite a list of typos, errors,
notational inconsistencies, and so on.

A few times, stumbling upon such a glitch in the text, I even tried to find confirmation for my
corrections out there in the Internet, only to discover, with my utter amazement and despair,
that only in very few cases was there already, somewhere, written proof that someone had noticed
the inconsistency and left notice of the correction for the future travellers of the same routes.

So I decided to collect here, in this documentation, [all the corrections](fixes.md) I would make, in pencil, on a
newly-bought copy of the book were I to hand it, as a gift, to a friend. The aim would be not to spoil
their enjoyment of the marvelous book but, rather, to make it smoother and less fragmentary.

As a disclaimer to this introduction, I hereby do not want, by any means, to diminish the
value of the book, which I deem one of the best readings of my recent life; nor do I claim that this list
of corrections is perfect: it may well be that some are plain wrong and that some are missing.

I can also absolutely not claim that it's all my own work:
there are some corrections, listed here, for which I sought guidance in other people's commentaries
on the internet. For these, due credit is specified in the fix list,
whenever I was able to track the origin.

Of course I am open to comments and corrections and will try to incorporate them in the present document,
trying to always give full credits where due, with the intent of making this document an up-to-date
erratum list for the book.

## Reference edition

<img src="/pictures/cover.png" alt="Book Cover" style="width: 50%;"/>

For definiteness (although I suspect most of the errata applies to other editions as well),
the edition I use as reference, including page numbers, is the following:

```text
To mock a Mockingbird and other logic puzzles

```

Here are relevant excerpts from the fourth paper page (i.e. not counting
the paperback cover):
```text

and a couple useful details from the last page before the closing paperback
cover (the first is the number reported in the barcode):

## Key

I divided the entries of the fix list according to the following categories:

* <img src="/pictures/correction_yellow.svg" width="32px"/>
Typos: notational inconsistencies, trivial corrections most likely due to typesetting errors
    (but nonetheless, sometimes, able to get in your way while following a proof).
* <img src="/pictures/correction_red.svg" width="32px"/>
Formula/proof errors:
    those provide a wrong starting point,
    severely compromise the unfolding of the reasoning,
    or give a wrong final result.
* <img src="/pictures/correction_green.svg" width="32px"/>
Immediate additions:
    alternative solutions (as good as the provided one),
    non-vital remarks or limitations of the provided reasoning,
    further clarification steps.
* <img src="/pictures/correction_blue.svg" width="32px"/>
Out-of-one's way bonuses:
    solution to additional exercises given as end-of-chapter training material,
    bonus material (e.g. computer programs) merely hinted at,
    and so on.
* <img src="/pictures/correction_black.svg" width="32px"/>
Open questions:
    issues sparked by the material encountered in the book
    for which I could not find a definite answer.
